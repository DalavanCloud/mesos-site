<h1>Mesos Architecture</h1>
<div class="image">
<img src="images/architecture3.jpg"  alt="Mesos Architecture"/>
</div>
<p>The above figure shows the main components of Mesos. Mesos consists of a <em>master</em> daemon that manages <em>slave</em> daemons running on each cluster node, and <em>Mesos frameworks</em> that run <em>tasks</em> on these slaves.</p>
<p>The master enables fine-grained sharing of resources (CPU, RAM, ...) across frameworks by making them <em>resource offers</em>. Each resource offer contains a list of &lt;slave ID, resource1: amount1, resource2, amount2, ...&gt;. The master decides <em>how many</em> resources to offer to each framework according to a given organizational policy, such as fair sharing or strict priority. To support a diverse set of policies, the master employs a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new allocation modules via a plugin mechanism.</p>
<p>A framework running on top of Mesos consists of two components: a <em>scheduler</em> that registers with the master to be offered resources, and an <em>executor</em> process that is launched on slave nodes to run the framework's tasks (see the <a class="el" href="app-framework-development-guide_8md.html">App/Framework development guide</a> for more details about framework schedulers and executors). While the master determines <b>how many</b> resources are offered to each framework, the frameworks' schedulers select <b>which</b> of the offered resources to use. When a frameworks accepts offered resources, it passes to Mesos a description of the tasks it wants to run on them. In turn, Mesos launches the tasks on the corresponding slaves.</p>
<h2>Example of resource offer</h2>
<p>The figure below shows an example of how a framework gets scheduled to run a task.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="images/architecture-example.jpg"  alt="Mesos Architecture"/>
</div>
<p>Let's walk through the events in the figure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Slave 1 reports to the master that it has 4 CPUs and 4 GB of memory free. The master then invokes the allocation policy module, which tells it that framework 1 should be offered all available resources.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The master sends a resource offer describing what is available on slave 1 to framework 1.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>The framework's scheduler replies to the master with information about two tasks to run on the slave, using &lt;2 CPUs, 1 GB RAM&gt; for the first task, and &lt;1 CPUs, 2 GB RAM&gt; for the second task.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Finally, the master sends the tasks to the slave, which allocates appropriate resources to the framework's executor, which in turn launches the two tasks (depicted with dotted-line borders in the figure). Because 1 CPU and 1 GB of RAM are still unallocated, the allocation module may now offer them to framework 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, this resource offer process repeats when tasks finish and new resources become free.</p>
<p>While the thin interface provided by Mesos allows it to scale and allows the frameworks to evolve independently, one question remains: how can the constraints of a framework be satisfied without Mesos knowing about these constraints? For example, how can a framework achieve data locality without Mesos knowing which nodes store the data required by the framework? Mesos answers these questions by simply giving frameworks the ability to <b>reject</b> offers. A framework will reject the offers that do not satisfy its constraints and accept the ones that do. In particular, we have found that a simple policy called delay scheduling, in which frameworks wait for a limited time to acquire nodes storing the input data, yields nearly optimal data locality.</p>

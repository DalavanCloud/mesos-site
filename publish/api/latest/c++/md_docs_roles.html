<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>In Mesos, <b>roles</b> can be used to specify that certain <a class="el" href="attributes-resources_8md.html">resources</a> are reserved for the use of one or more frameworks. Roles can be used to enable a variety of restrictions on how resources are offered to frameworks. Some use-cases for roles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>arranging for all the resources on a particular agent to only be offered to a particular framework.</li>
<li>dividing a cluster between two organizations: resources assigned for use by organization <em>A</em> will only be offered to frameworks that have registered using organization <em>A</em>'s role.</li>
<li>ensuring that <a class="el" href="persistent-volume_8md.html">persistent volumes</a> created by one framework are not offered to frameworks registered with a different role.</li>
<li>expressing that one group of frameworks should be considered "higher priority" (and offered more resources) than another group of frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles and access control</h2>
<p>There are two ways to control which roles a framework is allowed to register as. First, ACLs can be used to specify which framework principals can register as which roles. For more information, see the <a class="el" href="authorization_8md.html">authorization</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Second, a <em>role whitelist</em> can be configured by passing the <code>--roles</code> flag to the Mesos master at startup. This flag specifies a comma-separated list of role names. If the whitelist is specified, only roles that appear in the whitelist can be used. To change the whitelist, the Mesos master must be restarted. Note that in a high-availability deployment of Mesos, you should take care to ensure that all Mesos masters are configured with the same whitelist.</p>
<p>In Mesos 0.26 and earlier, you should typically configure <em>both</em> ACLs and the whitelist, because in these versions of Mesos, any role that does not appear in the whitelist cannot be used.</p>
<p>In Mesos 0.27, this behavior has changed: if <code>--roles</code> is not specified, the whitelist permits <em>any role name</em> to be used. Hence, in Mesos 0.27, the recommended practice is to only use ACLs to define which roles can be used; the <code>--roles</code> command-line flag is deprecated.</p>
<h2>Associating frameworks with roles</h2>
<p>A framework can optionally specify the role it would like to use when it registers with the master.</p>
<p>As a developer, you can specify the role your framework will use via the <code>role</code> field of the <code>FrameworkInfo</code> message.</p>
<p>As a user, you can typically specify which role a framework will use when you start the framework. How to do this depends on the user interface of the framework you're using; for example, Marathon takes a <code>--mesos_role</code> command-line flag.</p>
<h3>Multiple frameworks in the same role</h3>
<p>Multiple frameworks can use the same role. This can be useful: for example, one framework can create a persistent volume and write data to it. Once the task that writes data to the persistent volume has finished, the volume will be offered to other frameworks in the same role; this might give a second ("consumer") framework the opportunity to launch a task that reads the data produced by the first ("producer") framework.</p>
<p>However, configuring multiple frameworks to use the same role should be done with caution, because all the frameworks will have access to any resources that have been reserved for that role. For example, if a framework stores sensitive information on a persistent volume, that volume might be offered to a different framework in the same role. Similarly, if one framework creates a persistent volume, another framework in the same role might "steal" the volume and use it to launch a task of its own. In general, multiple frameworks sharing the same role should be prepared to collaborate with one another to ensure that role-specific resources are used appropriately.</p>
<h2>Associating resources with roles</h2>
<p>A resource is assigned to a role using a <em>reservation</em>. Resources can either be reserved <em>statically</em> (when the agent that hosts the resource is started) or <em>dynamically</em>: frameworks and operators can specify that a certain resource should subsequently be reserved for use by a given role. For more information, see the <a class="el" href="reservation_8md.html">reservation</a> documentation.</p>
<h2>The default role</h2>
<p>The role named <code>*</code> is special. Resources that are assigned to the <code>*</code> role are considered "unreserved"; similarly, when a framework registers without providing a role, it is assigned to the <code>*</code> role. By default, all the resources at an agent node are initially assigned to the <code>*</code> role (this can be changed via the <code>--default_role</code> command-line flag when starting the agent).</p>
<p>The <code>*</code> role behaves differently from non-default roles. For example, dynamic reservations can be used to reassign resources from the <code>*</code> role to a specific role, but not from one specific role to another specific role (without first unreserving the resource, e.g., using the <code>/unreserve</code> operator HTTP endpoint). Similarly, persistent volumes cannot be created on unreserved resources.</p>
<h2>Invalid role</h2>
<p>A role name must be a valid directory name, so it cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be an empty string</li>
<li>Be <code>.</code> or <code>..</code></li>
<li>Start with <code>-</code></li>
<li>Contain any slash, backspace, or whitespace character</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles and resource allocation</h2>
<p>By default, the Mesos master uses Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) to allocate resources. In particular, this implementation of DRF first identifies which <em>role</em> is furthest below its fair share of the role's dominant resource. Each of the frameworks in that role are then offered additional resources in turn.</p>
<p>The resource allocation process can be customized by assigning <em>weights</em> to roles: a role with a weight of 2 will be allocated twice the fair share of a role with a weight of 1. Weights are optional, and can be specified via the <code>--weights</code> command-line flag when starting the Mesos master. </p>

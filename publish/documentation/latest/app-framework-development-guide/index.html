		<h1>Framework Development Guide</h1>

<p>In this document we refer to Mesos applications as &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>See one of the example framework schedulers in <code>MESOS_HOME/src/examples/</code> to get an idea of what a Mesos framework scheduler and executor in the language of your choice looks like.</p>

<h2>Create your Framework Scheduler</h2>

<p>You can write a framework scheduler in C, C++, Java/Scala, or Python. Your framework scheduler should inherit from the <code>Scheduler</code> class (see API below). Your scheduler should create a SchedulerDriver (which will mediate communication between your scheduler and the Mesos master) and then call <code>SchedulerDriver.run()</code></p>

<h3>Scheduler API</h3>

<p>Declared in <code>MESOS_HOME/include/mesos/scheduler.hpp</code></p>

<pre><code>  /**
   * Empty virtual destructor (necessary to instantiate subclasses).
   */
  virtual ~Scheduler() {}

  /**
   * Invoked when the scheduler successfully registers with a Mesos
   * master. A unique ID (generated by the master) used for
   * distinguishing this framework from others and MasterInfo
   * with the ip and port of the current master are provided as arguments.
   */
  virtual void registered(SchedulerDriver* driver,
                          const FrameworkID&amp; frameworkId,

  /**
   * Invoked when the scheduler re-registers with a newly elected Mesos master.
   * This is only called when the scheduler has previously been registered.
   * MasterInfo containing the updated information about the elected master
   * is provided as an argument.
   */
  virtual void reregistered(SchedulerDriver* driver,
                            const MasterInfo&amp; masterInfo) = 0;

  /**

   * (e.g., the master fails and another is taking over).

  /**
   * Invoked when resources have been offered to this framework. A
   * single offer will only contain resources from a single slave.
   * Resources associated with an offer will not be re-offered to
   * _this_ framework until either (a) this framework has rejected
   * those resources (see SchedulerDriver::launchTasks) or (b) those
   * resources have been rescinded (see Scheduler::offerRescinded).
   * Note that resources may be concurrently offered to more than one
   * framework at a time (depending on the allocator being used). In
   * that case, the first framework to launch tasks using those
   * resources will be able to use them while the other frameworks
   * will have those resources rescinded (or if a framework has
   * already launched tasks with those resources then those tasks will
   * fail with a TASK_LOST status and a message saying as much).
   */

                              const std::vector&lt;Offer&gt;&amp; offers) = 0;

  /**
   * Invoked when an offer is no longer valid (e.g., the slave was
   * lost or another framework used resources in the offer). If for
   * whatever reason an offer is never rescinded (e.g., dropped
   * message, failing over framework, etc.), a framwork that attempts
   * to launch tasks using an invalid offer will receive TASK_LOST
   * status updats for those tasks (see Scheduler::resourceOffers).
   */
  virtual void offerRescinded(SchedulerDriver* driver,
                              const OfferID&amp; offerId) = 0;

   * lost and so the task is lost, a task finishes and an executor
   * sends a status update saying so, etc). Note that returning from

   * for whatever reason the scheduler aborts during this callback (or

<h2>Create your Framework Executor</h2>

<p>Your framework executor must inherit from the Executor class. It must override the launchTask() method. You can use the $MESOS_HOME environment variable inside of your executor to determine where Mesos is running from.</p>

<pre><code>  /**
   * Invoked once the executor driver has been able to successfully

   * data field.

</code></pre>

<h2>Install your Framework</h2>

<p>You need to put your framework somewhere that all slaves on the cluster can get it from. If you are running HDFS, you can put your executor into HDFS. Then, you tell Mesos where it is via the <code>ExecutorInfo</code> parameter of <code>MesosSchedulerDriver</code>&rsquo;s constructor (e.g. see src/examples/java/TestFramework.java for an example of this). ExecutorInfo is a a Protocol Buffer Message class (defined in <code>include/mesos/mesos.proto</code>), and you set its URI field to something like &ldquo;HDFS://path/to/executor/&rdquo;. Also, you can pass the <code>frameworks_home</code> configuration option (defaults to: <code>MESOS_HOME/frameworks</code>) to your <code>mesos-slave</code> daemons when you launch them to specify where all of your framework executors are stored (e.g. on an NFS mount that is available to all slaves), then set <code>ExecutorInfo</code> to be a relative path, and the slave will prepend the value of frameworks_home to the relative path provided.</p>

<p>Once you are sure that your executors are available to the mesos-slaves, you should be able to run your scheduler, which will register with the Mesos master, and start receiving resource offers!</p>
